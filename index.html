                    <h2>About Me</h2>

                    <p>
                        I started my journey through adulthood by becoming a cosmetologist.
                        I worked in a salon for several years and eventually wanted to challenge
                        myself with a career change.
                        I studied for the Comptia A+ Cert and started my tech job search.
                        I have been in IT support for 5 years. I have wanted to branch out further
                        and have a firm grasp on full stack web development which is what brought me
                        to the SMU bootcamp.
