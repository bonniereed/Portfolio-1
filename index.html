                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    I started my journey through adulthood by becoming a cosmetologist.
                    I worked in a salon for several years and eventually wanted to challenge
                    myself with a career change.
                    I studied for the Comptia A+ Cert and started my tech job search.
                    I have been in IT support for 5 years. I have wanted to branch out further
                    and have a firm grasp on full stack web development which is what brought me
                    to the SMU bootcamp.
